# [ModeVue](https://modevue.staticdesigner.com) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.0-blue.svg" alt="Version">

**ModeVue** â€” is a carefully crafted multi-purpose, responsive, and gorgeous theme. Built with Vue.js and Nuxt.js, it comes with the features you need to quickly start developing your application.

The theme is based on [Material Design Specification](https://material.io/guidelines/). We have used [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) as the front-end design framework.

## Build Setup

You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the following required software:

- Node https://nodejs.org/en/
- NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
- Vue CLI https://cli.vuejs.org/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `npm install` command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local development and production deployment. Once complete, type `npm run dev` and press the <kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at http://localhost:8080.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
